# Codem-transcode

* http://github.com/madebyhiro/codem-transcode

## Description

Codem-transcode is an offline video transcoder written in node.js. It

1. Uses ffmpeg for transcoding
2. Has a simple HTTP API
3. Is mostly asynchronous

Codem-transcode can be used in conjunction with Codem-schedule (https://github.com/madebyhiro/codem-schedule) for robust job scheduling and notifications or it can be used stand-alone, with or without a custom scheduler.

## Requirements

* ffmpeg (at least 0.10 and compiled/configured to your own taste)
* sqlite3/MySQL/PostgreSQL
* node.js version 0.8.x (x>=11), with packages (if you use npm they will be installed automatically):
    * sequelize (http://sequelizejs.com/)
    * sqlite3 (http://github.com/developmentseed/node-sqlite3)
    * express (http://expressjs.com/)
    * argsparser (http://github.com/kof/node-argsparser)
    * mkdirp (https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp)
    * async (https://github.com/caolan/async)

## Installation

The recommended installation procedure is to just use `npm` (http://npmjs.org/):

    # npm install codem-transcode

Install it to your preferred location, or use the `-g` option to install it globally.

## Upgrading

Upgrading should most of the times be as simple as shutting down, installing the new package and restarting the transcoder. Unless you're...

### Upgrading from earlier versions to 0.5 (IMPORTANT!)

Codem-transcode switched from using "plain" SQL (using sqlite) to a database abstraction layer (Sequelize). This brings some advantages
(support for multiple database engines, better consistency, easier migrations in the future), but is not backwards compatible. Therefore, we recommend you backup and move away your old database and
start with a fresh one. The procedure for this would be:

*   Shutdown the transcoder;
*   Move your database away (or delete if you're not interested in the history);
*   Install the new package;
*   Start the transcoder.

This will initialize a new up-to-date database which can be migrated to newer schema's more easily in the future. If you are doing a
clean install you do not need to worry about any of this.

If you want to keep your history we recommend you follow the above procedure and write a separate import script to import your old data
into the new database.

## Starting

When you install codem-transcode a script will be installed that allows you to start the transcoder. If you install it globally it should be in your `PATH`, otherwise, you can start the transcoder using:

    # /PATH/TO/TRANSCODER/bin/codem-transcode
    
Please check for yourself where `npm` installs your packages and script.

## Configuration

Configuration is done by specifying a CLI option (`-c`) and pointing to a file containing a valid JSON object (http://www.json.org/). Note that node.js' JSON parser is fairly strict so make sure you get the syntax right. An example config is:

    {
        "port":            8080,
        "access_log":      "/var/log/access_log",
        "database":        "/var/db/jobs.db",
        "slots":           8,
        "interface":       "127.0.0.1",
        "encoder":         "ffmpeg",
        "scratch_dir":     "/tmp",
        "use_scratch_dir": true,
        "ffprobe":         null
    }

Configuration options:

* `port`; port to start server on, default `8080`
* `interface`; which network interface to listen on, default `127.0.0.1` (only `localhost`)
* `access_log`; location to store HTTP access log, default `/var/log/access_log`
* `database`; location to store the jobs database, default is SQLite with `/var/db/jobs.db`
* `slots`; number of transcoding slots to use (i.e. the maximum number of ffmpeg child processes), defaults to the number of CPUs/cores in your machine
* `encoder`; path to the ffmpeg binary, if it is in your path specifying only `ffmpeg` is sufficient, defaults to `ffmpeg`
* `scratch_dir`; temporary files are written here and moved into the destination directory after transcoding, defaults to `/tmp`
* `use_scratch_dir`; if set to false temporary files will be written to the output directory of your job, for setups that don't require or are not able to use a separate `scratch_dir`. Defaults to `true` so if you don't want to disable the `scratch_dir` you can also omit this option from your config file.
* `ffprobe`; path to the ffprobe binary, if it is in your path specifying only `ffprobe` is sufficient, defaults to `null`. Set this to a non-null value if you want to enable ffprobe support in the transcoder.

Note that the default config will put the access_log and job database in `/var/log` and `var/db/` respectively. If you wish to put these in a different location please supply your own config. You can start the transcoder with your custom config using:

    # /PATH/TO/TRANSCODER/bin/codem-transcode -c /PATH/TO/CONFIG/config.json

### Advanced database configuration

codem-transcode supports multiple database backends, courtesy of Sequelize. The default is still to store data in a SQLite database (whenever you specify a string for `database` in the config file). To use MySQL or Postgres, supply a valid object for the database entry. Your configuration will then look like:

    {
        "port":            8080,
        "access_log":      "/var/log/access_log",
        "database":        {
            "dialect": "mysql",
            "username": "root",        
            "database": "codem",
            "host": "localhost"
        },
        "slots":           8,
        "interface":       "127.0.0.1",
        "encoder":         "ffmpeg",
        "scratch_dir":     "/tmp",
        "use_scratch_dir": true,
        "ffprobe":         null
    }

Be sure to specify a `dialect` ("mysql", "postgres", "sqlite"), a `username`, a `password` (can be omitted if using a passwordless database) and a `host` (can be omitted for "localhost").

## Usage

After starting the server you can control it using most HTTP CLI tools, such as `curl` or `wget`. The HTTP API is as follows:

* * *
Request: `POST /jobs`

Parameters (HTTP POST data, should be valid JSON object):

    {
        "source_file": "/PATH/TO/INPUT/FILE.wmv",
        "destination_file":"/PATH/TO/OUTPUT/FILE.mp4",
        "encoder_options": "-acodec libfaac -ab 96k -ar 44100 -vcodec libx264 -vb 416k -s 320x180 -y -threads 0",
        "thumbnail_options": {
            "percentages": [0.25, 0.5, 0.75],
            "size": "160x90",
            "format": "png"
        },
        "callback_urls": ["http://example.com/notifications"],
        "encoder": "ffmpeg" // this is optional but will overwrite your default encoder
    }

Responses:

* `202 Accepted` - Job accepted
* `400 Bad Request` - Invalid request (format)
* `503 Service Unavailable` - Transcoder not accepting jobs at the moment (all encoding slots are in use)

The `callback_urls` array is optional and is a list (array) of HTTP endpoints that should be notified once encoding finishes (due to the job being complete or some error condition).

The `thumbnail_options` object is optional and contains a set of thumbnails that should be encoded after the transcoding is complete. Thumbnails are captured from the source file for maximum quality. The options for thumbnails include:

* Either "percentages" or "seconds" (but not both at the same time), valid options are:
    * A single percentage, this will trigger a thumbnail every x%. `"percentages": 0.1` will generate thumbnails at 0%, 10%, 20%, [...], 100%.
    * An array of explicit percentages, this will trigger thumbnails only at the specified positions.
      `"percentages": [0.25, 0.5, 0.75]` will generate thumbnails at 25%, 50% and 75%.
    * A single offset in seconds, this will trigger a thumbnail every x seconds. `"seconds": 10` will generate thumbnails at 0 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, etc., until the end of the source file.
    * An array of explicit offsets, this will trigger thumbnails only at the specified positions.
      `"seconds": [30, 60, 90]` will generate thumbnails at 30 seconds, 60 seconds and 90 seconds.
* A size can be specified in pixels (width x height). If omitted it will generate thumbnails the size of the source video. (optional)
* A format for the thumbnails. The format must be supported by your ffmpeg binary. If omitted it will generate thumbnails in the JPEG format. Most people will use either "jpg" or "png". (optional)

If you specify thumbnails but an error occurs during generation, your job will be marked as failed. If you don't specify a valid `seconds` or `percentages` option thumbnail generation will be skipped but the job can still be completed successfully.

All other options are required (`source_file`, `destination_file` and `encoder_options`). Input and output files must be *absolute* paths.

### Thumbnail-only job

It's possible to only generate thumbnails from a video and not do any transcoding at all. This might come in handy if you're transcoding to lots of different formats and want to keep thumbnail generation separate from transcoding. You achieve this by POSTing a job with `"encoder_options": ""` (empty string) and of course specifying your `thumbnail_options`. In this case `destination_file` should be a _prefix_ for the output file, e.g. `"destination_file": "/Users/codem/output/my_video"` results in thumbnails in `/Users/codem/output/` with filenames such as `my_video-$offset.$format` (where `$offset` is the thumbnail offset in the video and `$format` of course the thumbnail format). All other options remain the same. See the examples.

* * *
Request: `GET /jobs`

Responses:

* `200 OK` - Returns status of all active jobs

* * *
Request: `GET /jobs/$JOB_ID`

Responses:

* `200 OK` - Returns status of job
* `404 Not Found` - Job not found

* * *
Request: `DELETE /jobs/$JOB_ID`

Cancels the job (if it is running) and deletes it from the database.

Responses:

* `200 OK` - Returns last known status of the job that is being deleted
* `404 Not Found` - Job not found

* * *
Request: `DELETE /jobs/purge/$AGE`

Purge successfully completed jobs from the database with a certain age. Age is specified in seconds since it was created. So an age of 3600 deletes jobs that were successful and created more than 1 hour ago.

Responses:

* `200 OK` - Returns number of jobs that were purged.

* * *
Request: `POST /probe`

Probe a source file using `ffprobe` (if you have enabled it in the configuration). Output is a JSON object containing the `ffprobe` output.

Parameters (HTTP POST data, should be valid JSON object):

    {
        "source_file": "/PATH/TO/INPUT/FILE.wmv"
    }

Responses:

* `200 OK` - Returns `ffprobe` output JSON-formatted
* `400 Bad Request` - Returned if you attempt to probe a file when there is no path set to the `ffprobe` binary
* `500 Internal Server Error` - Returned if there was an error while trying to probe, the output from `ffprobe` will be returned as well
